# Blokk
Blokk is a Tetris clone that aims to be:
* Extendable: Developers can easily implement their own game mechanics and game modes
* Configurable: Players can make detailed settings regarding (among other things) mechanics, rotation systems and controls

This project is currently in early development. So far it features:
* Game modes for one and two players
* Sending garbage lines in two player mode
* The standard rotation system (SRS)
* A few different block queues
* Keyboard and Gamepad support (no remapping possible yet)
* A simplistic menu without any configuration options
